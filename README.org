These are some programs I made for my [[https://monome.org/][monome]]. These are all very much a WIP and
probably not useful to anyone else besides me.

** Building

This is a standard autotools project, you'll need autoconf and automake
installed to build the code.

You'll also need [[https://github.com/monome/libmonome][libmonome]] and [[https://libevent.org/][libevent]] libraries and headers.

#+BEGIN_SRC
$ ./autogen.sh
$ ./configure
$ make
#+END_SRC

** Programs

=clear= clears the board

=monolife= is a simulator for Conway's game of life.

=percolate= is a percolation simulator.
